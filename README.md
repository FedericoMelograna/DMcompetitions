Data Mining example dataset.
In this repository there are three different example of Machine Learning techinque powered by R. 
The main library used is CARET,which provides a very clean way to control and tune your model's parameters. 
In detail there are three different problem: two regression and one classification problem. 

1) Boston Ames House: That one is a dataset in which we want to predict the price at which a house has been sold in the area of Boston.
The resulting best tecnique has been an ensemble beetween the result produced by a Gradient Boosting, a SVM and a Lasso penalized regression. 

2) In Bike Sharing the main topic is predicting the number of Rented Bike for the city of San Francisco for different days. In that case the main topic was feature engineering. We had -relatively- a lot of data and a small number of feature, so it was really important to create new feature. 

3) The last dataset was OKCupid, in which we want to classify if our customer worked in a STEM field or not.
